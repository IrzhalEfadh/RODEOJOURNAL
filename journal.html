    <h1>BEHIND RODEO</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>love has always been the thing i orbit around when i write songs. but RODEO is different. this time, i wasn’t chasing love, i was soaking in it. fully. finally. not wondering if i was enough. not hoping they’d stay. this album came from the warmth of arms that didn’t let go.</p>
    <p>RODEO is about thirst. for touch, yes—but not just skin. it’s about craving presence. eyes that look and keep looking. a hand that lingers. a silence that feels like safety. there’s a sensuality that runs through the whole thing, but it’s not about lust. it’s about wanting to be felt deep, like someone’s memorizing your soul.</p>
    <p>it sounds reckless. maybe a little sinful. but honestly, RODEO is the most romantic shit i’ve ever made. it’s messy, it’s bare, it’s loud in all the softest ways. a sinner can still be a good lover. especially when he finally knows what being loved back feels like.</p>
